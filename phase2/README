Details of Implementation

The full code can be divided into 2 broad parts.

1. The Market
The market is implemented in market.cpp and is called in the end of main.cpp. 
It reads orders from output.txt and outputs to outputs the result of trades to output.txt as well
Output is redirected to output.txt from standard output.

2. Trader
The trader consists of two parts - trader.cpp which contains your implementation of the trader. 
In part 1, we will be using blank_trader.cpp which will contain our trader to test your market.
In part 2, we will be using your trader.cpp file which also outputs the orders to output.txt
Output is redirected to output.txt from standard output.
